        <p style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Chai (Tea)</p>
        Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, 
        an evergreen shrub (bush) native to East Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world. 
        There are many different types of tea; some, like Darjeeling and Chinese greens, have a cooling, slightly bitter, 
        and astringent flavour, while others have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, floral or grassy notes.
        <br />Tea originated in Southwest China during the Shang dynasty, where it was used as a medicinal drink.
        An early credible record of tea drinking dates to the 3rd century AD, in a medical text written by Hua Tuo.
        It was popularized as a recreational drink during the Chinese Tang dynasty, and tea drinking spread to other East 
        Asian countries. Portuguese priests and merchants introduced it to Europe during the 16th century. During 
        the 17th century, drinking tea became fashionable among Britons, who started large-scale production and 
        commercialization of the plant in India. Combined, China and India supplied 62% of the world's tea in 2016.

        <u><b>Chemical composition</b></u><br />
        Caffeine constitutes about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating to between 30 milligrams (0.0011 oz) and 90 milligrams 
        (0.0032 oz) per 8-oz (250-ml) cup depending on the type, brand, and brewing method. A study found that the caffeine 
        content of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of black tea ranged from 22–28 milligrams (0.00078–0.00099 oz), while the caffeine content 
        of 1 gram (0.035 oz) of green tea ranged from 11–20 milligrams (0.00039–0.00071 oz), reflecting a significant difference.
        <br />
        The astringency in tea can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols. These are the most abundant compounds in tea leaves,
        making up 30–40% of their composition. Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and theophylline, which are stimulants,
        and xanthines similar to caffeine. Because of modern environmental pollution, fluoride and aluminium also sometimes occur in tea. 
        Certain types of brick tea made from old leaves and stems have the highest levels.
        <br />
        Black and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant amounts, with the exception of the dietary mineral, 
        manganese at 0.5 milligrams (1.8×10−5 oz) per cup or 26% of the Daily Value. Tea leaves contain diverse polyphenols, 
        including flavonoids, epigallocatechin gallate (commonly noted as EGCG) and other catechins. It has been suggested that 
        green and black tea may protect against cancer or other diseases such as obesity or Alzheimer's disease, but the 
        compounds found in green tea have not been conclusively demonstrated to have any effect on human diseases. 
        <br />
        One human study demonstrated that regular consumption of black tea over four weeks had no beneficial effect in 
        lowering blood cholesterol levels. Physically speaking, tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. 
        It is a solution of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted from the tea leaves, such as the polyphenols 
        and amino acids, but is a suspension when all of the insoluble components are considered, such as the cellulose in the 
        tea leaves.

        <u><b>Cultivation & Harvesting</b></u><br />
        Camellia sinensis is an evergreen plant that grows mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. Some varieties can also 
        tolerate marine climates and are cultivated as far north as Cornwall in England, Perthshire in Scotland, Washington state 
        in the United States, and Vancouver Island in Canada. In the Southern Hemisphere, tea is grown as far south as Hobart
        on the Australian island of Tasmania and Waikato in New Zealand.
        <br />
        Tea plants are propagated from seed and cuttings; about 4 to 12 years are needed for a plant to bear seed and about 
        three years before a new plant is ready for harvesting. In addition to a zone 8 climate or warmer, tea plants require 
        at least 127 cm (50 in) of rainfall a year and prefer acidic soils. Many high-quality tea plants are cultivated 
        at elevations of up to 1,500 m (4,900 ft) above sea level. Though at these heights the plants grow more slowly, 
        they acquire a better flavour.<br />
        Two principal varieties are used: Camellia sinensis var. sinensis, which is used for most Chinese, Formosan and Japanese teas, 
        and C. sinensis var. assamica, used in Pu-erh and most Indian teas (but not Darjeeling). Within these botanical varieties, 
        many strains and modern clonal varieties are known. Leaf size is the chief criterion for the classification of tea plants, 
        with three primary classifications being, Assam type, characterised by the largest leaves; China type, characterised by 
        the smallest leaves; and Cambodian type, characterised by leaves of intermediate size. The Cambod type tea (C. assamica 
        subsp. lasiocaly) was originally considered a type of assam tea. However, later genetic work showed that it is a hybrid 
        between Chinese small leaf tea and assam type tea. Darjeeling tea also appears to be hybrids between Chinese small leaf tea 
        and assam type tea.<br />
        A tea plant will grow into a tree of up to 16 m (52 ft) if left undisturbed, but cultivated plants are generally pruned to
        waist height for ease of plucking. Also, the short plants bear more new shoots which provide new and tender leaves and 
        increase the quality of the tea. Only the top 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) of the mature plant are picked. These buds and leaves 
        are called 'flushes'. A plant will grow a new flush every seven to 15 days during the growing season. Leaves that are slow 
        in development tend to produce better-flavoured teas.
